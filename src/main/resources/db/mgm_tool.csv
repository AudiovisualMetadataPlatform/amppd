extract_audio,ffmpeg,Extract the audio from an audio or video file to a wav file.
ina_speech_segmenter,inaSpeechSegmenter,"INA Speech Segmenter is an open-source audio segmentation tool created by L’Institut National de l'Audiovisuel that separates audio recordings into speech, silence (""no energy""), music, and noise. Silence (“no energy”) is the absence of any sound (e.g., a tape is not recording audio). Noise is any ambient sound, even minimal sound barely detectable by the human ear. Results from the AMP implementation are output as time ranges with labels denoting the type of segment. (Noise and silence segments are only counted if they are a minimum of 10 seconds.) "
applause_detection,Acoustic Classification Segmentation,"Applause Detection is a tool based on the open-source Acoustic Classification and Segmentation audio segmenter from the Brandeis Lab for Linguistics & Computation. The model used with this tool was trained by the AMP development team on audio from MUSAN corpus, HIPSTAS applause samples, and sound from Indiana University collections. This tool inputs an audio file and outputs segments of applause and non-applause with start and end timecodes for each."
aws_transcribe_stt,Amazon Transcribe,"Amazon Transcribe is a proprietary web service that provides transcription (with word-level confidence scores) and diarization, or speaker identification, for up to 10 speakers."
kaldi_stt,Kaldi,Kaldi is an open-source application for transcription. The AMP implementation transcribes English language speech and produces results without punctuation or speaker identification.
aws_comprehend_ner,Amazon Comprehend,"Amazon Comprehend is a commercial service for named entity recognition and other natural language processing methods. Comprehend detects the following entity types:
COMMERCIAL_ITEM:  A branded product
DATE:  A full date (for example, 11/25/2017), day (Tuesday), month (May), or time (8:30 a.m.)
EVENT:  An event, such as a festival, concert, election, etc.
LOCATION:  A specific location, such as a country, city, lake, building, etc.
ORGANIZATION:  Large organizations, such as a government, company, religion, sports team, etc.
OTHER:  Entities that don't fit into any of the other entity categories
PERSON:  Individuals, groups of people, nicknames, fictional characters
QUANTITY:  A quantified amount, such as currency, percentages, numbers, bytes, etc.
TITLE:  An official name given to any creation or creative work, such as movies, books, songs, etc."
spacy_ner,spaCy,"SpaCy is an open-source Python library for a variety of types of natural language processing, including named entity recognition. The AMP implementation uses SpaCy’s en_core_web_lg model to detect the following entities from input: 
PERSON:      People, including fictional.
NORP:        Nationalities or religious or political groups.
FAC:         Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc.
ORG:         Companies, agencies, institutions, etc.
GPE:         Countries, cities, states.
LOC:         Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water.
PRODUCT:     Objects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services.)
EVENT:       Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc.
WORK_OF_ART: Titles of books, songs, etc.
LAW:         Named documents made into laws.
LANGUAGE:    Any named language.
DATE:        Absolute or relative dates or periods.
TIME:        Times smaller than a day.
PERCENT:     Percentage, including ”%“.
MONEY:       Monetary values, including unit.
QUANTITY:    Measurements, as of weight or distance.
ORDINAL:     “first”, “second”, etc.
CARDINAL:    Numerals that do not fall under another type."
azure_shot_detection,Azure Video Indexer,Azure Video Indexer is a proprietary video intelligence platform from Microsoft. Shot and scene detection is included as part of this platform. The AMP implementation uses the shot detection feature only.
pyscenedetect_shot_detection,PySceneDetect,"PySceneDetect is an open-source application that offers two options for detecting transitions in video–content, which looks for changes in the content of frames, and threshold, which uses a set intensity level for frames and looks for changes in average intensity to detect transitions. The AMP implementation uses the content algorithm. "
dlib_face_recognition,dlib Face Recognition,"Dlib Face Recognition is an open source Python library for detecting and manipulating faces in images. The AMP implementation allows a user to submit training images of the faces they wish to find in videos, then Face Recognition will detect and label similar faces, returning time stamps, bounding coordinates, and labels of faces it has detected. Face Recognition will only try to recognize and label faces submitted by the user for training for a specific workflow."
azure_video_ocr,Azure Video Indexer,Azure Video Indexer is a proprietary video intelligence platform from Microsoft. Video OCR is included as part of this platform.
tesseract_video_ocr,Tesseract,Tesseract is an open source application for OCR of still images. FFmpeg is used to extract frames of a video at specified intervals to run through Tesseract.
