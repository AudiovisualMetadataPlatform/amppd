audio_segmentation,Audio Segmentation,"<p>Audio segmentation is the classification of audio stream samples into types of sound, such as speech or music, that when joined together, indicate distinct regions of homogeneous sound.</p>"
applause_detection,Applause Detection,"<p>Applause detection classifies segments of sound as “applause” or “non-applause.” When used in combination with audio segmentation, this MGM can be useful for finding start and end times of musical works or other types of performances. </p>"
"speech_to_text	",Speech to Text,"<p>Speech to text transcription (also known as automatic speech recognition, or ASR) is the recognition of spoken language in an audio stream and conversion to text.</p>"
named_entity_recognition,Named Entity Recognition,"<p>Named entity recognition (NER), or entity extraction, is a type of natural language processing (NLP) that attempts to identify and classify entities or concepts, like people, places, organizations, products, and topics, in unstructured text. The AMP tool implementations take in outputs from speech-to-text, HMGM transcript editor, and video OCR. Data outputs include entity text, entity type, character offsets, start time, and relevance score (if offered by the tool).</p>"
shot_detection,Shot Detection,"<p>Shot detection is a method for finding transitions in video content and separating them into separate structural temporal units. Automated shot detection can support a number of purposes such as supporting copyright review by providing keyframes from each shot showing any secondary content or potential rightsholders (like art on walls, performers), and detecting scene changes in theater productions. Depending on the tool, types of shot transitions may include dissolve (fade out/in), cut, pan, zoom in, and zoom out.</p>"
facial_recognition,Facial Recognition,<p>Facial recognition is the detection and identification of human faces in a video based on a model trained with images of known individuals. </p>
video_ocr,Video Optical Character Recognition,"<p>Video OCR is the recognition of text in video content, for example, words on objects like signs or clothing, subtitles and captions, or opening/ending credits. Video OCR algorithms may use a variety of methods for detecting text over a series of video frames.</p>"
