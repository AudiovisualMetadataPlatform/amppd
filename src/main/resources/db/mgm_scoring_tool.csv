speech_to_text	,Word Error Rate,word_error_rate.py,transcript,txt,"<p>Word error rate measures speech-to-text accuracy by comparing the generated transcript against a ground truth transcription and calculating the number of errors (substitutions, additions, and deletions) as the cost of restoring the output word sequence to the original input sequence. Scores are measured as percentages, with lower scores representing high accuracy (low word error rate). Scores may exceed 100%, especially if the STT engine produced many insertions. Related to WER, character error rate (CER) is similar to WER, but based on characters, the word information loss (WIL) measures the proportion of word information lost in a transcription, and word information processed (WIP) measures the inverse of WIL.</p>
